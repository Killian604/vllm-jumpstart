# vLLM Jumpstart

## Purpose

I intend to provide an easy face by which you can use vanilla Python to programmatically interface
with your own vLLM server.

## Usage:
See `demo1.py` for usage. There are 3 main porcelain commands which I recommend starting with.
See bottom of `vllm_util.py` when you're ready.
